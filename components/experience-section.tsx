        "Own the web platform of four real-estate brands (elevacap.com, soleblu.mx, villageblu.com.mx and campaign landings): performance, structured data, SEO and uptime.

Built a PHP REST bridge that exposes Elementor's internal layout tree for programmatic editing, with per-post permission checks, automatic state backup and cache purge, replacing a manual workflow that had no rollback path. Automated content and audit operations with ~40 Python scripts over the WordPress REST API: SEO and schema.org audits, bulk metadata remediation, 404 and canonical fixes, and media optimization. Shipped a marketing landing on Astro and Cloudflare Workers scoring 100/100 in all four Lighthouse categories.",
